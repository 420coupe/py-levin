# py-levin

Monero p2p implementation in pure Python.

I started reverse engineering epee/Levin until I came across [m2049r's](https://github.com/m2049r) excellent work on [Monerujo](https://github.com/m2049r/xmrwallet/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/m2049r/levin), at which point it became a port.

Provides the building blocks to create and receive Levin packets.
